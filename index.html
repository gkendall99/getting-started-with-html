  <!-- This line is an HTML comment, and comments are for taking notes on your code.  The notes written are "invisible" to the PC and will be ignored. This topic was not covered in the opening sessions of this class but I wanted to incorporate it into my learning. -->

<!-- The <head> element contains information that won't be displayed on the page.  This line was taken from Andy's Notes page in CODEPEN.  Thank you Andy.  This information is like a page name I am assuming. -->

  <title>Glenn's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Notes</title>

<!-- The following notes also came from "Andy's Notes page in CODEPEN".  This too was not part of the course but I wanted to add it to my page notes so I do not miss too many concepts of web programming.  The <h1> tag stands for "heading 1". Heading tags go all the way up to <h6>. Lower numbered headings indicate content that is more important. -->

<h1>Important Concepts I Have Learned Thus Far!</h1>

<!-- Everything past this section is all my notes I have taken, and no other help from Andy's Codepen page was used.  -->

<b>NOTE:</b> I have an understanding of how the web works, how  web paging works (the fundamentls), and how servers work<br> as it pertains to <b><em>HTML</em></b> because of my past IT experience, so I will not bother to write it down for my own notes.

<br>
<b>HTML</b> - <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</b>
<p>Text Content - "What you see"<br>
  Markup - "What it looks like"<br>
  Reference to other documents (e.g. images and videos)<br>
  Links to other documents<br><br>
  <b>HTML MARKUP</b><br><br>
  - - <u>TAGS</u> - - <br><br>
  <<name>name> contents <<name>/name><br>
  <!-- NOTE: I'm sure the above coding for the Element is wrong but it is the best that I could do at guessing the code structure without referencing Google -->
  ___^_____________^___<br>
  Opening Tag - Closing Tag<br><br>
  This whole item is called an "Element" (Opening tag, contents, and closing tag)<br><br>
  Tags learned so far...<br><br>
  "b" tag (bold) - For making text <b>BOLD</b><br>
  "em" tag (emphasis) - For making text <em>ITALICISED</em><br>
  "u" tag (underline) - For making text <u>underlined</u> (not covered in class, added for fun)
  <!-- This concept was not in the training but I guessed it would work, and it did. --><br><br><br>
  - - <u>HTML ATTRIBUTES</u> - -<br><br>
  < TAG > ATTR="Value"> contents < /TAG ><br><br>
<!-- NOTE: I'm sure the above coding for the HTML ATTRIBUTES is wrong but it is the best that I could do at guessing the code structure without referencing Google -->
Attributed Tags...<br><br>
"a" tag (anchor) - For making <u>links</u>, call "Anchors"<br><br>
"Anchor Example Below For Google"<br><br>
<a href="https://www.google.com"> <b>Google</b></a><br><br>
<!-- Reminder to myself to "cite" Google when submitting this for feedback. -->
"img" tag (images) - For adding images<br><br>
< IMG > SRC="URL" alt="text"> <br>
"Alt="text" is the name of the image that shows if/when the link to the images gets broken<br>
"Alt="text" is required when making a coode site, needed for blind users<br>
There is no closing tag for images, this is called a "void tag" - no content<br><br>
"Image Example Below For Udacity's "Hipmunk!"<br>
<img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="Hipmunk!"><br><br>
<!-- Reminder to myself to "cite" Udacity and Hipmunk image when submitting this for feedback. -->
- - WHITE SPACE - -<br><br>
Text on multiple lines - reads all on ONE (1) line<br>
"br" tag (break) - Use this tag to put a break in a line to continue on the next line<br>
"br" tag is a void tag<br><br>
"p" tag (paragraph) - Similar to the break tag, but it creates an invisible box around the text. (This will be explained more later)<br>
The "p" tag is <b>NOT</b> a void tag<br>
"< p > contents < /p >
<br><br>
<p>- - INLINE/BLOCK - - (Elements)<br><br>
  Inline Tags:<br>
  < br ><br>
    < a ><br>
      < span ><br>
        < img ><br>
          < strong ><br><br>
  Block Tags:<br>
    < div ><br>
      < p ><br>
        < form ><br><br>
          </p>
- - SPAN/DIV - -<br>
      < span > text < /span > (inline)<br>
      < div > text < /div > (block)<br><br>

 The old saying I remember about computers is "Garbage In, Garbage Out".<br>
 Udacity knows it as "Computers are stupid", either way it's right.  Computers only know what you tell it.<br><br>
 END NOTES!
